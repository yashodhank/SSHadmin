####Remote administrator of SSH connections with the following multiple functionalities:

- Data and file exchange, as well as projects, photos and videos <br>
- Invisible remote access <br>
- Automation for VNC server configuration on the remote machine and installation of necessary programs <br>
- Redirects for graphical execution of Applications <br>
- Data traffic with pages visited in plain text <br>
- Access to the camera device through <b>optical nerve</b> (without turning on the camera light) <br>
- SSH connections without password <br> 
- Possibility of poisoning among other things <br>

<b>These are the steps you have to follow:</b>

- First execute the program on your local machine as local when asked <br>
- Then, private ip's on your local network will be saved in a file <br>
- A menu will be loaded <br>
- First through option 1 you see the ip's stored, and you choose one (need to know the remote machine name) <br>
- Once this is done, you need to run the program on the remote machine, through option 2 an identical copy of the program will be stored in the /tmp directory of the remote machine (you need to know the password) <br>
- Next, you chose option 3 to establish a remote connection to the remote machine, you can choose option 4 for doing an invisible remote connection to the remote machine <br>
- Then you go to /tmp directory and execute the program, this time as remote (remote script has another menu) <br>
- The program will install the necessary applications on the remote machine to execute the script correctly (the user will not notice) <br>
- A new menu will appear and then you can select one of the new options to perform, such as viewing the webcam, analyzing data traffic, collapsing the system, etc. <br>

##You can try it with your own machine (your user-name machine and your private-ip machine)
